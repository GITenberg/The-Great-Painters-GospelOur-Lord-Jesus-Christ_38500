            THE USE OF PICTURES IN TEACHING.

        <p>
            PICTURES may hold a primary or secondary place in
            teaching, according to their nature and the aim of the
            teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The text itself</b> may be the supreme thing, and
            pictures become mere pictorial comments upon the text.
            Pictures when so used have the nature of <i>views</i>
            or <i>illustrations</i>. The picture at the head of
            this page is a view. It is reproduced from a photograph
            taken directly from nature. Such pictures are of great
            value in building up in the mind clear images of
            objects or of scenes beyond the pupil's reach. A map
            means almost nothing to a person unfamiliar with the
            country, unless by means of numberless views the
            appearance of the country has been made known to the
            mind. Every teacher in Sunday-school should have a
            collection of photographic views of the historical
            sites of the Bible, of implements, household utensils,
            articles of dress, etc., which may be used to make
            clear the Biblical references to such things. Without
            such illustrations words may convey little or no
            meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first picture upon the next page may be called an
            illustration. To a person unfamiliar with the text it
            might convey any meaning but the true one; but to one
            familiar with the story of Christ and the rich young
            ruler it is wonderfully graphic and satisfactory. The
            words of the text take on a deeper meaning as they are
            studied in the light of this picture. Because Hofmann
            is an artist, a man gifted with imagination, he sees
            more clearly, more vividly than the average person.
            Seen through his eyes what was before vague and
            unconvincing becomes definite and powerful. Before
            seeing the picture the pupil had heard the
            words:"Jesus, looking upon him, loved him." Now with
            the picture he <i>sees</i> that Jesus loves him and is
            anxious to have him decide for life everlasting. Before
            "the poor" were abstract; now they become a concrete
            reality. Before the pupil had been told that the young
            man had "great possessions;" now he sees that he had
            also health and beauty and intelligence, greater
            possessions than land and gold. The Sunday-school
            teacher is fortunate who has at his command pictures
            which illustrate, which make luminous the text. Plates
            <a href="#11">11</a>, <a href="#20">20</a>, <a href=
            "#34">34</a>, <a href="#39">39</a>, <a href=

            "#143">143</a> may be mentioned as notable examples of
            good illustrations to supplement the text.

            The picture itself may be the object of study, and the
            text become a commentary upon the picture. For example,
            consider this picture by Holman Hunt. Every detail has
            something important to say to the pupil. The postures
            of these people and the costumes say "oriental." The
            profuse ornamentation both of the architecture and the
            various furnishings speak of extraordinary conditions.
            This is the temple which was the wonder of the age (see
            Mark 13:1), and these are the people who loved to go
            about in long clothing, and who "devoured widows'
            houses" to be rich. (Matt. 23:14.) This boy with his
            pure face and far-away-gazing eyes is he who had
            thoughts about "his Father's house." The look in the
            woman's face is appreciated in the light of what she is
            recorded as having said, "I have sought thee
            sorrowing." (Luke 2:48.) That she rather than her
            husband should speak to him is no surprise to one
            familiar with Matt. 1:18-25. The faces of these
            serious-looking men must be read in the light of the
            words, "And all that heard him were amazed at his
            understanding and answers." One man has an ornamental
            box in his hand. What is that for? Another has a
            similar box upon his forehead. Why? Deut. 6:6-8 and
            Matt. 23:5 will help answer those questions. A man is
            begging at the entrance. It is not extraordinary in the
            light of Acts 3:1, 2, and Mark 14:7. He begs in vain
            outside, while within a servant brings wine to refresh
            those who will not so much as lift a finger to help the
            burdened. (Matt. 23:4.) Beyond the beggar craftsmen are
            still at work upon the temple. Yes, because when this
            child Jesus first visited the temple it was not
            completed. "Forty and six years was this temple in
            building." (John 2:20.) Birds are flying in and out!
            "Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a
            nest for herself, . . . even thine altars, O Lord of
            Hosts." (Ps. 84:3.) The little boy with the fly-driver
            tells the season of the year, the light and the few
            worshippers and the idle musicians tell the time of
            day. Everything has a message, even the ornament upon
            wall and floor! That tells whence the Jews derived
            their art. This picture is more than a commonplace
            illustration of a single text: it is a graphic
            presentation of an era. The particular event is shown
            in its historical setting. The picture is a supreme
            work of art.

            If pictures of this sort are to be studied, every pupil
            in the class should have a copy. The teacher's business
            is to direct the pupil to individual observation and
            inquiry. The perpetual questions should be, What do you
            see? What does it mean? Why is that here? What does it
            contribute to the total content of the picture? What
            does the picture as a whole have to say? Plates
            <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href=
            "#18">18</a>, <a href="#25">25</a>, <a href=

            especially worthy of this analytical and exhaustive
            study.

            Occasionally pupils will find both interest and profit
            in the comparative study of a series of pictures. For
            example take the five plates of The Annunciation,
            <a href="#1">pages 9 and 10</a>. After the facts have
            been determined by a study of the text, the
            investigation may proceed as follows: What are the
            essential elements found in all the pictures alike?
            Which artist has told the story most simply and
            directly? The different artists have emphasized or
            given special attention to some one phase or phrase.
            Which has embodied more perfectly the first, or the
            second, or the third? Which has introduced elements of
            his own? Why? Do they help? Which has, on the whole,
            told the story most vividly? Which most beautifully? A
            study of this group of pictures in the light of such
            notes as will be found printed therewith, will enable
            any teacher to formulate for himself a plan for
            studying any other group of pictures.

            In such study it is essential that each pupil be
            supplied with a complete set of the pictures to be
            compared.

            But the picture itself is sometimes not a thing to be
            consciously analyzed and inventoried; it is simply a
            thing of beauty, "its own excuse for being;" it is
            something to be received as a whole with thankfulness,
            like the odor of wild grape vines, or the form of a
            calla lily, or the color of a sunrise, or the music of
            wind in pine trees. Such a picture is this Madonna of
            the Shop, by Dagnan-Bouveret. One may think for a
            moment now and then of how well the picture is
            composed, of how perfect a master of his art the man
            must be who can make spots of paint suggest wood and
            metal, linen and wool, soft flesh and softer light, but
            the mind returns again and again to the contemplation
            of the wondrous sweet face of the Virgin, whose deep
            eyes see unspeakable things. One comes to love such a
            picture as a dear familiar friend, and to yield to its
            gentle influence as to moonlight upon the sea. The
            contemplation of such pictures is one of the purest
            pleasures of life, a foretaste of the sight of "the
            King in his Beauty."

        </h2>

            The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a virgin whose
            name was Mary. The angel said "Hail, Mary, highly
            favored, blessed art thou among women." (Luke 1:26-28.)
            Mary is supposed to have been in a house of worship at
            the time (like Hannah, 1 Sam. 1:9-18, and Zacharias,
            Luke 1:8-13), hence the beautiful surroundings; and to
            have been at prayer, as suggested by the kneeling
            posture and the book. The dove is a symbol of the Holy
            Ghost (Luke 3:22). The beam of light symbolizes the
            going forth of divine power (Hos. 6:5). The angel is
            borne upon a cloud (Ps. 104:3), and carries a rod or
            scepter, symbols of authority (Ex. 4:1-5, Esther 4:11).
            The lily is introduced as a symbol of perfection and
            purity (Song 2:2; compare also Num. 17:8). Titian has
            depicted the instant when the angel says "Hail, Mary."
            He has introduced emblems of the ideal woman (Prov.
            31:13, 14, 26, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Hofmann, Plate 1,</b> shows the moment when Gabriel
            says: "Blessed art thou among women." (Luke 1:28.) In
            this picture only, the angel approaches from behind.
            The picture recalls the experience of another Mary
            (John 20:14).

            my Father which is in heaven." (Matt. 18:10.)

            save his people from their sins." (Matt. 1:21.) Does

            taketh away the sin of the world? (John 1:29.) One lamb
            is already slain, and lies in the foreground. The
            shepherd with the lamb in his arms may unconsciously
            illustrate the Christ (Is. 40:11), and the odd disk
            above the head of the older shepherd, catching the
            light from the child, may be prophetic of saintly

            present him to the Lord, and to offer a sacrifice,
            according to the ancient law. And Simeon, waiting for

            "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
            for mine eyes have seen thy salvation." (Luke 2:25-35.)

            very hour, gave thanks to God and spake of him to all

            THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Now when Jesus was born there came wise men from the
            east, guided by a star, which went before them till it
            stood over the place where the young child was. . . .
            And when they were come into the house they saw Jesus
            and Mary his mother, and fell down and worshipped him;
            and when they had opened their treasures they presented
            unto him gifts; gold, frankincense and myrrh. (Matt.
            2:9-11.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Hofmann, Plate 20,</b> represents the arrival. The
            star stands above the head of the child. The tradition
            is that one wise man came from Europe, one from Asia
            and one from Africa (See <i>Ben-Hur</i>, Book I.);
            hence Hofmann has represented one with the oriental
            turban, one with a helmet having hanging side pieces
            like an Egyptian head dress, and one with the simple
            band, the white hair and flowing beard of the Druid.

            THE RETURN TO NAZARETH.
        </h2>
        <p>
            When Herod was dead, Joseph, instructed by an angel,
            brought Mary and Jesus into the land of Israel, and
            made them a home in Nazareth. The mother with her
            divine child in this Nazareth home has ever been the
            favorite subject with painters. "Madonna" pictures have
            been multiplied into the thousands. The most famous are
            those which were painted by Raphael,&mdash;the Sistine
            Madonna, Madonna of the Chair, Madonna da Tempi,
            Madonna of the Goldfinch, etc.,&mdash;reproductions of
            which are familiar to everybody. Among other famous
            painters of the Madonna is <b>Murillo,</b> who, in
            <b>Plate 32,</b> represents the mother and child as the
            neighbors might have seen them in their humble home.
            The child is of course beautiful. (Luke 2:40.) In
            <b>Plate 33,</b> the artist has emphasized the last
            phrase of Luke 2:40, "The grace of God was upon him."
            The Father in heaven is visibly present, and the grace
            descends upon the child in the form of a dove, as
            suggested by Luke 3:22. The action of all the accessory
            figures, the arrangement of the light, everything in
            the picture, is calculated to focus the attention upon
            the face of the child Christ.

            <b>Hofmann, Plate 31,</b> tells of the quiet days at
            Nazareth, when Joseph worked at his trade, and Mary sat
            near spinning and watching the wondrous lad who in his
            child-way could help Joseph by fetching a needed tool.
            It was a peaceful, happy life, like that of the
            chickens and the doves. The memories of those days
            furnished Jesus with the wonderful figure of speech
            recorded in Matt. 23:37, 38. Hofmann, like other
            artists, is fond of symbolism, hence the square and the
            measuring stick are upon the shoulder of the child (Is.
            9:6) who was to lay judgment to the line and
            righteousness to the plummet (Is. 28:17); and the tools
            take the form of the cross. Jesus was subject unto his
            parents (Luke 2:51), and, in a sense, took up his cross
            daily, as all his disciples must ever do (Matt. 16:24).
            Such service is healthful and profitable (Luke 2:52).

            THE VISIT TO JERUSALEM.

            Joseph and Mary probably went every year to Jerusalem
            at the feast of the passover. (Deut. 16:16.) And when
            Jesus was twelve years old they went up as usual taking
            him with them. (Luke 2:41-42.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Mengelberg, Plate 34,</b> represents the holy family
            approaching the city. The temple with its smoking
            altars is seen in the distance. The artist has
            suggested the great company who went up every year to
            worship, and with which, returning, Joseph and Mary
            supposed Jesus to be.

            <b>Hofmann, Plates 38 and 39,</b> illustrates (Luke

            Life of Christ. Plate 39, from the famous painting in
            Dresden, is the more carefully finished. Hofmann has
            shown the seal of Solomon upon the "chair of
            philosophy," he has introduced the scroll of the
            prophets and suggested the rich stones of the temple,
            but the interest of all is upon the Boy, who came to
            fulfill the law and the prophets, and who was greater
            than the temple and greater than Solomon. (Matt. 5:17,
            John 2:19-20, Matt. 12:42). This picture has become a

            of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his
            loins." (Matt. 3:1-4.) He seems to be saying, "Behold
            the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
            world." (John 1:29.) The river is introduced as a
            symbol (Luke 3:16), and the lamb also (John 1:35). Del
            Sarto seems to have studied this figure before painting

            Walking by the sea of Galilee one morning, Jesus saw
            two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his
            brother, . . . and two other brethren, James, the son
            of Zebedee, and John his brother, with their nets, for
            they were fishermen. And he called them: "Come ye after
            me and I will make you fishers of men." These four
            became his first disciples. (Matt. 4:18-22.)

        <p>
            <b>Zimmermann, Plate 47,</b> has seized upon the moment

            and John are nearest Jesus, the other two in the
            background. "Fishers of men;" the phrase is mysterious;
            they cannot understand it. Nevertheless, they leave all

            call of the four fishermen: "When he had finished
            speaking he said to Simon, Push off into deep water,
            and then all throw out your nets for a haul." "We have
            been hard at work all night, sir," Simon answered, "and
            have not caught anything, but as you say so, I will
            throw the nets out." They did so, and they enclosed
            such a great shoal of fish that their nets began to
            break. So they signalled to their mates in the other
            boat to come and help them; which they did, filling
            both the boats so full of fish that they were almost
            sinking.

            the house, servants came saying that the child was
            dead: but they went on to the house of Jairus. Clearing

            Shortly after the Transfiguration Jesus talked with his

            "He took a little child in his arms and said unto them,
            Whosoever shall humble himself as this little child,
            the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."

            Jesus went on his way towards Jerusalem, and when he
            came within sight of the city he wept over it and said,
            "Would that you had learned, while there was
            time&mdash;yes, even you&mdash;the things that make for
            peace! But as it is, they have been hidden from your
            sight. For a time is coming for you when your enemies
            will surround you with earthworks, and encircle you,
            and hem you in on every side; they will trample you
            down and your children within you, and they will not

            their garments upon a colt, and set Jesus thereon, and
            accompanied him from Bethpage to Jerusalem, waving palm
            branches (John 12:13), and spreading garments and palms

            In the morning the trial is continued before Pilate.
            Probably no one has painted that scene so well as has
            <b>Munkacsy, Plate 141.</b> The picture is true to the
            accounts of the evangelists, and is besides a great
            study of character. The face of Christ is about the
            only inadequate piece of representation in the whole
            picture. Munkacsy has evidently followed Luke's
            account. "And they began to accuse him, saying, We
            found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to
            give tribute to C&aelig;sar." The moment may be that
            after which Pilate says, "I find no fault in this man,"
            and the accusers "become more urgent, saying, He
            stirreth up the people" (Luke 23:4, 5).

            Pilate at last delivered Jesus over to be crucified.
            "And he went out bearing the cross for himself."
            Through loss of sleep and loss of blood, worn out with
            the long agony, Jesus fainted, and fell beneath the
            load of the cross. They compelled a man whom they met
            coming in from the country, Simon the Cyrenean, to bear
            the cross for Jesus, and thus, accompanied by a crowd
            of people, they came at last to Calvary. The scene
            which followed has been painted hundreds of times, as a
            whole, and in detail, sometimes with almost revolting
            realism, sometimes with fascinating power.

            has given up his spirit into his Father's hands. (Luke
            23:46.) Amid rending rocks and opening tombs the

            vision at the sepulchre, are on their way to tell the
            disciples. (Luke 24:9-10.) These are the women whose
            words seemed to the disciples but idle tales unworthy
            of belief. (Verse 11.)

        <p>
            That very evening at Jerusalem, Jesus appeared to the
            disciples who were gathered in an upper room. Thomas,
            one of the twelve, was absent, and doubted when the
            others told him that they had seen the Lord. (John
            20:24, 25.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Eight days later the disciples were again together,
            Thomas being with them. Suddenly Jesus stood in the
            midst. (John 20:26.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Guercino, Plate 170,</b> shows what followed. "Then
            said he to Thomas, reach hither thy finger and see my
            hand, and reach hither thy hand and put it into my
            side; and be not faithless, but believing." (John
            20:27.) The painter has given Jesus a banner as a
            symbol of victory, a Christian symbol as old as the
            catacombs.

            THE ASCENSION.
        </h2>
        <p>
            At the end of forty days Jesus appeared to the
            disciples once more, and after giving final
            instructions as to their future work, "he led them out
            until they were over against Bethany: and he lifted up
            his hands and blessed them." (Luke 24:50.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Hofmann, Plate 171,</b> illustrates the next verse.
            "And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted
            from them, and was carried up into heaven." In Acts the
            added information is given that "a cloud received him
            out of their sight." (Acts 1:9.) Luke says, "they
            worshipped him" (verse 52); but Hofmann has angels
            worshipping (the "two men" of Acts 1:10), for the
            disciples are too greatly astonished to worship just
            then.

            <b>Rembrandt, Plate 172,</b> emphasizes the glory of it
            all. The prayer of Christ (John 17:5), is answered, the
            promise of God (John 12:28), is fulfilled. The Spirit
            which appeared at the baptism of Jesus in the form of a
            dove, descending upon him as he began his ministry,
            here descends again as he enters the heavens where he
            ever liveth to make intercession for us.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
